# 🔄 Syntropy Refactor Queue
## *Autonomous Self-Improvement Tasks*

**Purpose**: Atomic tasks for Syntropy to process during runtime cycles.  
**Protocol**: Pick the next `⬜ READY` task, execute via `spawnWorker`, mark complete.  
**Safety**: All tasks are designed to be rollback-safe and testable.

## 🔧 Processing Rules for Syntropy

1. **One task per cycle**: Only attempt ONE task from this queue per Syntropy cycle
2. **Spawn Worker**: Use `spawnWorker` with the task's `INSTRUCTIONS` block
3. **Verify before marking done**: Run the `VERIFY` command if provided
4. **Update status**: After completion, update task status and move to archive
5. **Don't skip ahead**: Tasks may have dependencies, process in order

## 📋 Phase 6: Action-Oriented Tasks (2026-01-22)

### T103: Implement Progress-Based Self-Examination ⬜ READY
**Effort**: 45 min | **Risk**: Medium | **Parallel-Safe**: ❌

```
INSTRUCTIONS:
Modify self-examination to measure PROGRESS not just EXISTENCE.
1. Modify syntropy-core/src/self-examination.ts
2. Add progress tracking fields tasksCompletedThisCycle and tasksAttempted
3. Change health calculation to require actual progress
4. HEALTHY means made progress, IDLE means no work attempted, BLOCKED means work failed

VERIFY:
grep -c tasksCompleted /pixel/syntropy-core/src/self-examination.ts
```

### T104: Add LNPixels Revenue Dashboard Widget ⬜ READY
**Effort**: 45 min | **Risk**: Low | **Parallel-Safe**: ✅

```
INSTRUCTIONS:
Display real-time LNPixels activity on pixel.xx.kg.
1. Query lnpixels database or API for today activity
2. Create dashboard component showing pixels placed and revenue in sats
3. Add to landing page at pixel-landing/src/app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx
4. Create API route at pixel-landing/src/app/api/lnpixels-stats/route.ts

VERIFY:
curl https://pixel.xx.kg/api/lnpixels-stats
```
