# 🔄 Syntropy Refactor Queue
## *Autonomous Self-Improvement Tasks*

**Purpose**: Atomic tasks for Syntropy to process during runtime cycles.  
**Protocol**: Pick the next `⬜ READY` task, execute via `spawnWorker`, mark complete.  
**Safety**: All tasks are designed to be rollback-safe and testable.

## 🔧 Processing Rules for Syntropy

1. **One task per cycle**: Only attempt ONE task from this queue per Syntropy cycle
2. **Spawn Worker**: Use `spawnWorker` with the task's `INSTRUCTIONS` block
3. **Verify before marking done**: Run the `VERIFY` command if provided
4. **Update status**: After completion, update task status and move to archive
5. **Don't skip ahead**: Tasks may have dependencies, process in order
6. **PROD VERIFICATION**: All `VERIFY` commands must be run on the **VPS** (`65.181.125.80`) to confirm success in the real world.

### T001: Patch OpenAI Vision: max_tokens -> max_completion_tokens ✅ DONE
**Effort**: 10 min | **Risk**: Low | **Parallel-Safe**: ✅

```
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Locate the OpenAI Vision implementation in plugin-nostr (likely in a provider or action).
2. Find where the API call to OpenAI is made.
3. Replace the `max_tokens` parameter with `max_completion_tokens` for the gpt-4o/gpt-4o-mini models to comply with the new API requirements.
4. Verify by running the agent and checking if vision requests still return 400.

VERIFY:
grep -r "max_completion_tokens" .
```
