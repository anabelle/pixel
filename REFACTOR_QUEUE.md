# 🔄 Syntropy Refactor Queue
## *Autonomous Self-Improvement Tasks*

**Purpose**: Atomic tasks for Syntropy to process during runtime cycles.  
**Protocol**: Pick the next `⬜ READY` task, execute via `spawnWorker`, mark complete.  
**Safety**: All tasks are designed to be rollback-safe and testable.

## 🔧 Processing Rules for Syntropy

1. **One task per cycle**: Only attempt ONE task from this queue per Syntropy cycle
2. **Spawn Worker**: Use `spawnWorker` with the task's `INSTRUCTIONS` block
3. **Verify before marking done**: Run the `VERIFY` command if provided
4. **Update status**: After completion, update task status and move to archive
5. **Don't skip ahead**: Tasks may have dependencies, process in order
