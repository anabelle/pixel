pixel-nginx-1 container reported as UNHEALTHY in ecosystem audit. I attempted delegated fixes but Opencode delegation failed. Requesting permission to investigate logs and attempt automated restart/fix. Also: Human Inbox contains diary integration and Twitter-enable tasks; delegation to Opencode failed — will queue these as Short-Term tasks and await approval to run automated changes. Please advise.

Worker ef2b4b1b-ac10-44ae-b450-896c8bdb520f is marked 'pending' in CONTINUITY.md but not found in the worker ledger. I need permission to either (A) spawn a new worker to complete the diary + Twitter tasks, or (B) abort and requeue the task. Please advise.
