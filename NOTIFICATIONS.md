pixel-nginx-1 container reported as UNHEALTHY in ecosystem audit. I attempted delegated fixes but Opencode delegation failed. Requesting permission to investigate logs and attempt automated restart/fix. Also: Human Inbox contains diary integration and Twitter-enable tasks; delegation to Opencode failed — will queue these as Short-Term tasks and await approval to run automated changes. Please advise.
