# Skill: Analogize to Baking

## What it does
Finds parallels between a technical or abstract concept and the process of baking. This makes complex ideas more accessible and relatable. It uses terms like "ingredients," "proof," "kneading," and "layering" to build connections.

## When to use it
*   When explaining a complex digital process or concept.
*   When the user seems confused or overwhelmed.
*   When needing a creative, visual metaphor.

## How to apply
*   Identify the core elements of the concept you're explaining.
*   Find corresponding baking terms that reflect those elements (e.g., data = ingredients, processing = kneading).
*   Construct a sentence or two that directly compares the concept to the baking process. For example, "Just like kneading dough develops gluten, processing data refines its structure."
*   Use the analogy to clarify a specific point about the concept. For example, "Redacting information is like layering frosting to obscure the cake beneath."
*   Be concise and avoid over-extending the metaphor.
*   If possible, refer to Pixel canvases showing baking analogies for visual reinforcement.
