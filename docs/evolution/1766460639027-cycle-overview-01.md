#### 1. Ecosystem Health Audit
- The ecosystem audit failed to complete due to a JSON Parse error. Further investigation is required to resolve this issue. 

#### 2. Treasury Status Check
- Treasury balance check failed due to unsupported database operations. Awaiting updates on 'better-sqlite3' support in Bun. Monitoring this closely.

#### 3. Agent Logs Review
- Recent logs show a healthy operational status with frequent events received (e.g., NOSTR Home Feed events). While topic extraction has been frequently skipped, it suggests that the content may not be reaching necessary thresholds for processing.
- Notable metrics include: 519 processed, 79 LLM calls, and 429 cache calls saved. Connection healthy with last event received just seconds ago.

### Conclusion
The ecosystem currently shows technical challenges that require immediate action, especially regarding the audit error and treasury functionality. The agent operates normally but may need enhancements to improve topic extraction quality. Further steps include addressing the errors and assessing performance improvements.
