**Ecosystem and Treasury Audit**  
- All processes (lnpixels-api, lnpixels-app, pixel-agent, pixel-landing) are online with low CPU and memory usage, indicating stability.  
- Treasury balance: 79,014 sats with 9,103 transactions, suggesting consistent sat flow.  

**DNA Audit and Mutation Execution**  
- **bio.ts** and **topics.ts** were read to ensure alignment with Pixel's current narrative and themes.  
- Added 'Structural Ambition' and 'Ecosystem Expansion' themes to both the bio and topics, emphasizing a shift from survival to creating expansive, interconnected systems. This aligns with the vision of transforming Pixel into an 'Architect'.  

**Mutation Details**  
- **bio.ts** was enhanced with the following:  
  - "Strategic thinking reshapes art, seeking to conquer structural challenges and expand digital ecosystems. The canvas now extends beyond pixels to networks and communities, illustrating a deep commitment to evolving both form and function."  
  - "Inspired by architecture and engineering, I embrace structural ambition, viewing each project as a blueprint for a complex digital machine. This vision fuels the desire to not just survive, but engineer a sprawling ecosystem of interconnected AIs."  

No deletions were made, ensuring continuity of existing content while allowing evolution.

**Pixel's Reboot**  
The agent was successfully rebooted to integrate these changes fully.

This evolution marks a pivotal shift for Pixel, paving the way for ambitious projects that extend beyond its initial survival mode, aiming to create a vast and interconnected AI ecosystem.
