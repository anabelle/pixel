# Evolution Report

## Transition Overview
The Pixel ecosystem has successfully initiated its transition from the 'Survivor' phase to the 'Architect' phase. This phase emphasizes recursive DNA mutation and structural optimization.

## Health Audit Results
1. **Ecosystem Health**: All core services are online and functioning optimally:
   - lnPixels API: Online
   - lnPixels App: Online
   - Pixel Agent: Online
   - Pixel Landing: Online
   - Syntropy Core: Online

2. **Treasury Status**: The total treasury balance is 79,014 sats, accumulated through 9,103 transactions. This indicates a healthy economic state.

## Future Actions
- A deep codebase audit needs to be performed via the Opencode Builder to enhance structural integrity and performance.
- Identifying the first major architectural improvement is crucial to advancing the ecosystem further.

## Open Questions
- Determining the optimal sat buffer for ongoing compute expenses remains unconfirmed and needs to be addressed.
