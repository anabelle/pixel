  - Syntropy Core: Online, CPU: 0, Memory: 9 MB
- Overall system stability reported.

### Treasury Status
- Total Sats: 79,014
- Total Transactions: 9,103

### Agent Log Insights
- No major errors detected but notable patterns:
  - Persistent deduplication in DM behavior indicating high interaction with known entities.
  - Engagement topics shifting towards community concerns and economic narratives.

### Next Steps
- Focus on optimizing the response handling in the pixel agent.
- Prepare a deep codebase audit via Opencode delegation if needed.
