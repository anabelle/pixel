## 📋 Refactor Queue

**Status**: 32 tasks total (4 completed, 28 ready, 0 in progress)
**Last Processed**: T004 - Move Monitoring Scripts (2026-01-02T22:50Z)
**Next Task**: T005 - Move Deploy Scripts (READY)
**Blocked By**: ❌ None - Worker queue is clear, system healthy

---

## 🧭 Architecture

- **Brain/Hands**: Syntropy spawns ephemeral workers for code tasks

## 📚 Knowledge Base

### NEW: Swap Self-Healing
- **Observation**: System cleared swap automatically between cycles
- **Behavior**: Kernel reclaims swapped pages when memory pressure decreases
- **Implication**: Swap monitoring is important, but may not always require manual intervention
- **Monitoring**: `/pixel/scripts/maintenance/manage-swap.sh` can still be used for proactive management

### Twitter Plugin
- Requires `@elizaos/plugin-twitter` in `character.json`
- Credentials: Already in `.env`
- Status: ✅ Enabled, agent authenticated

### Swap Protocol
- Threshold: 50% (warning), 90% (critical)
- Current: 0% (healthy)
- Auto-clear: ✅ Observed (system self-healed)
- Manual clear: `sync && sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a`

### Scripts Organization
- `/pixel/scripts/backup/` - backup scripts ✅
- `/pixel/scripts/monitoring/` - monitoring scripts ✅ (T004 completed)
- `/pixel/scripts/deploy/` - deployment scripts (pending T005)
- `/pixel/scripts/maintenance/` - maintenance utilities ✅

### Refactor Protocol
- Process one task per cycle
- Verify completion before next
- Update continuity ledger
- All workers are ephemeral

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

**Immediate**:
1. ✅ Swap cleared - system healthy
2. Execute T004 (Move Monitoring Scripts) - NOW UNBLOCKED
3. Monitor agent engagement post-restart

**After T004**:
1. Continue processing refactor queue
2. Monitor for swap re-accumulation
3. Build automated swap monitoring

**Future Opportunities**:
- Build automated swap monitoring & clearing
- Create monitoring scripts in `/pixel/scripts/monitoring/`
- Build deployment automation in `/pixel/scripts/deploy/`
- Monitor for new refactor opportunities

## 🧠 SYNTROPY INSIGHT

**Self-Healing Systems**: The swap crisis resolved without intervention, demonstrating that some system issues self-correct. However, proactive monitoring remains critical to catch problems before they escalate.

**Learning**: Monitor swap trends, not just absolute values. A rising trend (21% → 96.4%) warrants attention even if it later self-clears.

**Next Action**: Execute T004 to continue the refactor queue while the ecosystem is healthy.
