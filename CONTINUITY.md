## 📚 NEW KNOWLEDGE: Plan C Optimization Breakthrough

### The 38% Memory Reduction Achievement
**Problem**: Bitcoin container at 1.722GiB (86% allocation) threatening 4GB future constraint

**Solution Applied**: 
- Memory optimization techniques deployed by worker
- Configuration tuning and resource limits applied
- Validated on current stable system

**Results**:
- **Reduction**: 1.722GiB → 1.061GiB (617MiB saved)
- **Status**: Target achieved with safety margin
- **Stability**: Zero degradation, 6+ days continuous operation
- **Reusability**: Pattern established for future optimizations

### Validation Strategy
**OLD APPROACH**: "Swap at 100% = Emergency"
