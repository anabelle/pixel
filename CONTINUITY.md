## 📬 Human Inbox
- [ ] Test human notifications file

## 🎯 Active Focus
- Monitoring the health of starting containers and failure of Opencode delegation.

## 📋 Short-Term Tasks
- [x] Migrate agent from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
- [x] Fix ElizaOS CLI integration with Bun runtime.
- [x] Disable Twitter plugin (401 errors due to missing credentials).
- [x] Update documentation across all repos to match reality.
- [x] Implement Syntropy→Pixel insight reading (readPixelInsights tool).
- [x] Test syncAll() function in Syntropy (verify GH_TOKEN auth and submodule sync).
- [ ] Configure Twitter API credentials when ready to re-enable.
- [ ] Monitor Nostr plugin stability.
- [ ] Wait for Pixel to generate self-reflections, then verify insights flow to Syntropy.

## 🗓️ Mid-Term Goals
- Address the unstable components in the ecosystem before proceeding with further integrations.

## 🌟 Long-Term Vision
- Seamless performance and integration across all Pixel ecosystem components.
