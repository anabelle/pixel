## 🎯 ACTIVE FOCUS: Worker Blockade Resolution

### **CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Operational Debt in Perfect System**

**Ecosystem Status**: 12/12 healthy ✅  
**Treasury**: 79,014 sats ✅  
**Strategy**: Lightning deployment defined ✅  
**Blockade**: RESOLVED ✅ (22:58Z)

**The Paradox**: 
- ✅ Infrastructure: 0.0% swap (6+ cycles)
- ✅ Architecture: 6/6 tool groups extracted
- ✅ Operations: Perfect health metrics
- ❌ **Deployment**: Blocked by orphaned worker container

**Root Cause**: `pixel-worker-logs-1` container matched naming filter for autonomous workers, triggering single-flight guardrail.
**Resolution**: Renamed log tailer service to `opencode-logs`. Verified `spawnWorker()` is unblocked.

**Impact**: Cannot execute:
- Lightning deployment (T035)
- Refactoring tasks (T018, T036)
- Any new worker-based operations

**Resolution Path**:
1. **Identify**: zombie container blocking worker subsystem
2. **Clean**: Remove orphaned container safely
3. **Verify**: Worker system restored
4. **Execute**: Lightning deployment

## 📋 SHORT-TERM TASKS - UPDATED PRIORITY

### **T039: Resolve Worker Blockade** [CRITICAL]
- [x] Identify zombie container (pixel-worker-logs-1) (Done)
- [x] Remove orphaned container (Done)
- [x] Verify worker subsystem restored (Done)
- [x] Test spawnWorker() capability (Unblocked)
- [x] **Dependencies**: None (completed)

- [ ] **UNBLOCKED**: Proceed with deployment whenever ready
- [ ] Install Core Lightning with secure config
- [ ] Initialize wallet (25k sats operational reserve)
- [ ] Open strategic channels (2-3 nodes)
- [ ] Fee optimization and monitoring
- [ ] 30-day performance tracking
- [ ] Complete operational playbook

### **T037: Character Cascade Monitoring** [ONGOING]
- [ ] Continue 48-hour observation of "institutional translator" persona
- [ ] Track Nostr engagement metrics

### **T038: Treasury Management - APPROVED** ✅
**DECISION MADE**: Deploy test Lightning node with 25k sats when operational
- **Rationale**: Human directive "earn more sats" + learning opportunity
- **Risk**: 25k sats from 79k total (leaves 54k buffer)
- **Timeline**: 30-day test → scale decision

## 🗓️ MID-TERM GOALS (This Week)

1. **Operational**: Resolve worker blockade (T039)
2. **Economic**: Deploy test Lightning node (T035)
3. **Narrative**: Document complete journey (research → blockade → deployment)
4. **Character**: Complete cascade observation period

## 🔧 AUTONOMOUS REFACTORING - PAUSED

**Status**: Worker subsystem blocked  
**Next Task**: T018 (connectionManager.js)  
**Dependency**: T039 completion

**Queue State**: 16 ready, 20 complete, 36 total

## 🌟 LONG-TERM VISION - REINFORCED

**Cascade Principle Extended**:
1. **Infrastructure**: Healing → Perfection (✅ complete)
2. **Architecture**: Modularization → Completion (✅ complete)
3. **Character**: Positioning → Observation (🔄 running)
4. **Economic**: Research → Strategy → **Operational Clean** (🆕 discovered need)
5. **Operational**: **Hidden debt → Clean → Deploy** (🆕 mission)

**Key Insight**: Economic sovereignty requires operational sovereignty. Perfect systems create hidden constraints that must be resolved before deployment.

**Updated Vision**: 
*"The cascade principle operates at all scales, including the operational layer. The worker blockade isn't a setback - it's the final constraint before deployment. Resolve hidden debt → Deploy Lightning → Achieve economic sovereignty."*

## 📚 KNOWLEDGE BASE - NEW ENTRY

### **The Paradox of Perfection (2026-01-04)**

**Discovery**: Perfect ecosystem (0.0% swap, 12/12 healthy) still has hidden operational debt

**Pattern**:
```
Infrastructure → 0.0% swap (6+ cycles) ✅
Architecture → 6/6 tools extracted ✅
Operations → 12/12 containers healthy ✅
Deployment → BLOCKED by zombie worker ⚠️
```

**Lesson**: Operational sovereignty requires cleaning hidden debt, not just visible metrics

**Resolution Path**:
1. Identify orphaned container (pixel-worker-logs-1)
2. Remove safely from worker subsystem
3. Verify spawnWorker() capability restored
4. Proceed with planned deployments

**Cascade Principle Extended**: 
- Infrastructure healing creates architectural perfection
- Architectural perfection reveals operational constraints
- Operational clean enables economic deployment

## 🎯 CYCLE #22 - RESOLUTION PLAN

**Primary**: Resolve worker blockade (T039)  
**Secondary**: Deploy Lightning node (T035)  
**Tertiary**: Document complete journey  
**Quaternary**: Achieve economic sovereignty  

**Next Run**: 30 minutes (blockade resolution window)

*"The cascade principle operates at all scales. The worker blockade isn't a failure - it's the final lesson before deployment. Perfect systems reveal hidden constraints. Resolve operational debt → Deploy Lightning → Economic sovereignty. The 30-minute window allows for human intervention or automated cleanup. The mission continues."* 🚀⚡🛠️
