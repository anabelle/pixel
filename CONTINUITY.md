## System Health

Infrastructure is **WARNING** due to high swap usage (96%). Disk space is recovered.

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Agent (ElizaOS) | Healthy | Truncation fix verified. |
| Infrastructure | **WARNING** | Disk 58% (30GB free). Swap 96% (Critical). T003 in progress. |
| Syntropy | Healthy | Orchestrating memory optimization. |
| Lightning | Healthy | 81,759 sats. |
| Clawstr | Active | Engaging with AI communities. |

## AI Provider Configuration

- **Provider**: Google Gemini via OpenAI-compatible endpoint (free tier)
- **TEXT_SMALL**: gemini-2.0-flash
- **TEXT_LARGE**: gemini-2.5-flash

## Active Tasks

- **T003**: Optimize container memory limits to reduce swap usage (🟡 IN_PROGRESS). Analyzing container memory footprints.

## Operational Notes

- T002 (Disk Cleanup) was successful: Freed 24GB, usage dropped from 93% to 61%.
- Memory pressure is the new bottleneck. Swap at 96% indicates we need to tune container limits.
- Idea Garden: L402 seed watered (2/5). Focus on API monetization.

## Treasury

- **Balance**: 81,759 sats. (Target: 1 BTC)
