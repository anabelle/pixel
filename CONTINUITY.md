# Continuity Ledger

- **Goal**: Implement and automate a Continuity Ledger for the Syntropy Oversoul to ensure session stability across context compaction.
- **Constraints/Assumptions**: 
    - Syntropy operates autonomously via PM2.
    - Intelligence is driven by AI SDK 6 (gpt-4o-mini).
    - Workspace is a monorepo with submodules.
- **Key decisions**:
    - Use a dedicated `CONTINUITY.md` file in `syntropy-core/`.
    - Add native tools to Syntropy for ledger management.
- **State**: Initializing protocol.
- **Done**: 
    - Synced all repos to GitHub.
    - Improved Syntropy reporting and audit logging.
    - Established Opencode delegation bridge.
- **Now**: Implementing the Continuity Ledger protocol for the Oversoul.
- **Next**: 
    - Update Syntropy tools to manage its own ledger.
    - Update Syntropy instructions.
- **Open questions**: None.
- **Working set**:

    - `/home/pixel/pixel/syntropy-core/src/tools.ts`
