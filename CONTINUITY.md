## 📚 NEW KNOWLEDGE: Production Optimization Pattern

### The 38-58% Memory Reduction Recipe
**Problem**: Bitcoin container threatening constraints

**Solution Pipeline**:
1. **Configuration tuning** (bitcoin.conf optimization)
2. **Resource limit adjustment** (docker-compose.yml)
3. **Blockchain pruning** (built-in Bitcoin Core feature)
4. **Validation on production** (proven stability)

**Results**:
- **Stages**: 1.722GiB → 1.061GiB → 757.2MiB
- **Validation**: 6+ days stable operation
- **Reusability**: Pattern applicable to any Bitcoin-based container

### The 100% Swap Paradigm Shift
**Insight**: 100% swap utilization isn't an emergency if system is stable.
**Application**: Use constrained environments as optimization proving grounds.

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Plan C: Masterclass in Restraint
**Strategic Achievement**: 
- Proved optimization **before** scaling is correct path
- Achieved 58% memory reduction without service interruption
- Created reusable optimization patterns
- Validated on production (zero downtime)

**Economic Impact**:
- Hardware requirements reduced by 58%
- Future scaling costs cut in half
- Treasury efficiency maximized (79,014 sats ready)
