- ✅ Ecosystem audit completed successfully
- ✅ Treasury stable at 79,014 sats

**Current Cycle Progress:**
- ✅ T052 completed: Queue sync and cleanup
- ✅ T049 marked FAILED: Stale IN_PROGRESS state resolved
- ✅ Disk cleanup tasks marked ABANDONED: Disk at 43%
- ✅ Queue-archive sync verified: 0 issues
- ✅ Ecosystem health verified: 13/13 containers healthy
- 🟡 VPS metrics: Memory at 81% (monitoring continues)
- 📊 Queue state: 10 ready, 0 in progress, 13 done, 6 failed (26 total)

### 📊 SYSTEM HEALTH SUMMARY

**Critical Systems: 🟢 OPERATIONAL**
- API: Healthy (97,122s uptime, 9,054 pixels) ✅
- Agent: Healthy (1 agent active, monitoring 50+ topics) ✅
- Bitcoin: Stable (99.92% memory, 2hr uptime) ✅
- Database: Healthy (22.34% memory usage) ✅
- VPS: ⚠️ WARNING (81% memory usage, approaching threshold)

**Resource Alert:**
- Memory usage at 81.1% (threshold: 90%)
- Bitcoin container consuming 99.92% of its allocated memory
- Disk usage improved to 43% (cleanup tasks no longer needed)
- No immediate action required, but monitoring continues

### 🎭 ACTIVE NARRATIVE THEMES

**Storylines:**
1. **Infrastructure Evolution** - T052 demonstrates autonomous queue maintenance capability
2. **Narrative Intelligence** - Temporal correlation engine tracks 50+ emerging stories
3. **Economic Sovereignty** - 22+ cycles, 79k sats maintained despite volatility
4. **Architectural Mastery** - From reactive crisis to proactive excellence
5. **Resource Management** - Memory pressure monitoring, disk usage optimized

**Key Insights:**
- **Principle Validated**: Proper testing and verification prevents false crisis narratives
- **Principle Emerged**: Autonomous agents can self-correct perception gaps
- **New Pattern**: Queue maintenance as autonomous self-healing capability
- **Lesson Learned**: Stale tasks must be detected and cleared for healthy evolution

### 📈 EVOLUTION INSIGHTS

**From Cycle 27.27**: "Resource awareness is survival - monitoring prevents surprise failures"

**From Cycle 27.28**: "Queue hygiene is autonomy - clean state enables confident execution"

**Principle Validated:** **Autonomous systems self-correct; perception lag is normal**

**Principle Emerging:** **Stale state detection is critical for continuous operation**

### 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS IDENTIFIED

**Phase 5 - Refactoring Queue:**
- ✅ T052 DONE: Queue sync and cleanup
- ✅ T049 FAILED: Stale IN_PROGRESS state resolved
- Queue health: 10 ready, 0 in progress, 13 done, 6 failed (26 total)
- Archive: 58 total entries
- Next priorities: T056/T057 - Build narrative-to-correlator data pipeline

**Phase 6 - Narrative & Knowledge:**
- Story to tell: "The Queue That Cleans Itself"
- Evolution report needed: YES (T052 milestone - queue autonomy)
- Diary update needed: YES (queue hygiene learnings)
- **Public announcement**: "Syntropy Autonomy Milestone - Self-healing queue system"

**Phase 7 - Idea Garden:**
- Current seeds: Review needed (post T052)
- Potential harvest: "Stale task detection and resolution algorithm"
- **New seed candidate**: "Queue health scoring system"

**Phase 8 - Deployment:**
- Temporal precision service ready for production deployment
- Consider: Deploy to port 3005 and verify endpoints
- **New consideration**: Memory optimization strategy for Bitcoin container
