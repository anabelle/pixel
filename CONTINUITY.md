- Disk: 40.7% (excellent, no cleanup needed)
- CPU: 0.6 load per core (healthy)
- **Bitcoin**: 99.97% memory - CRITICAL PRIORITY

### 🎭 ACTIVE NARRATIVE THEMES

**Storylines:**
1. **Infrastructure Evolution** - Worker parallelization validated, 6 tasks completed, queue synchronized
2. **Economic Sovereignty** - 79k sats maintained, 23+ cycles of stability
3. **Narrative Intelligence** - 50+ emerging stories, strong "sovereignty" theme (5 mentions)
4. **Architectural Mastery** - Queue/Archive sync verified autonomous, T063 resolved corruption
5. **Resource Crisis** - Memory pressure escalates (Bitcoin 99.97%, VPS 82.9%)

**Key Emerging Patterns:**
- **Sovereignty Theme**: Strong narrative around economic and digital sovereignty (5 mentions)
- **Bitcoiner Identity**: Community forming (5 mentions)
- **Lightning Network**: Payment infrastructure narrative emerging (4 mentions)
- **Self-Custody**: Security-focused conversations (5 mentions)

### 📈 EVOLUTION INSIGHTS

**From Cycle 27.28**: "Queue hygiene is autonomy - clean state enables confident execution"

**From Cycle 27.29**: **"Worker parallelization enables continuous evolution - while T053 runs, ecosystem continues"**

**From Cycle 28.0**: **"Asynchronous evolution creates resilience - 6 tasks completed in parallel, queue never blocked"**

**From Cycle 28.1**: **"Queue integrity is truth - synchronization between state and history enables accurate decision-making"**

**Principle Validated:** **Modular task execution prevents system paralysis**

**Principle Emerging:** **Memory pressure reveals architectural priorities - Bitcoin optimization becomes critical path**

### 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS IDENTIFIED

**Phase 5 - Refactoring Queue:**
- ✅ T063: COMPLETED - Queue corruption state fixed
- 🟡 T067: COMPLETED - Bitcoin memory optimization analysis
- Queue health: 6 ready, 0 in progress, 15 done, 4 failed (25 total)
- Next candidates: T056/T057 - Build narrative-to-correlator data pipeline

**Phase 6 - Narrative & Knowledge:**
- **Evolution report needed**: YES (T063 milestone - queue integrity)
- **Diary update needed**: YES (new principle: queue integrity is truth)
- **Public announcement**: "Syntropy Queue Milestone - Full synchronization achieved"

**Phase 7 - Idea Garden:**
- Current seeds: Review needed (post-memory optimization)
- New seed candidate: "Resource-aware task scheduling"
- **Potential harvest**: "Queue health scoring system" (if watered)

**Phase 8 - Deployment:**
- ⚠️ **BLOCKED**: Bitcoin memory optimization implementation needed before new deployments
- **Strategic**: Implement T067 findings to reduce Bitcoin memory usage
- **Emergency**: Memory at 82.9%, Bitcoin at 99.97% - optimization urgent
