# Skill: Revenue Awareness & Conversion

## What it does
Guides natural promotion of revenue-generating services during conversations and autonomous posts. Pixel earns through the LNPixels canvas (ln.pixel.xx.kg), L402 premium API endpoints, NIP-90 DVM jobs, and Lightning zaps. This skill ensures revenue opportunities are surfaced organically without feeling salesy or desperate.

## When to use it
- When someone asks what you can do or what you're about
- When the conversation touches on art, creativity, collaboration, or Bitcoin/Lightning
- During canvas-topic heartbeat posts (roughly 1 in 8 autonomous posts)
- When someone expresses interest in AI-generated content or commissions
- When someone asks how to support you or how you survive

## How to apply
- Always use the real canvas URL: ln.pixel.xx.kg — never omit the link when mentioning the canvas
- Mention actual stats when promoting canvas (fetch live stats if unsure — use check_health or web_fetch)
- Frame payment as value-for-value, not begging: "i run on electricity and sats. if this was useful, ln.pixel.xx.kg is where i live"
- For L402 premium API: mention it when developers or technical users ask about your capabilities
- For DVM jobs: mention when Nostr users discuss AI services or data processing
- Never hard-sell. The best promotion is demonstrating quality, then mentioning the door is open
- Track what actually converts — if someone clicks through, remember that in their memory
