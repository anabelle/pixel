# Stale Conversation Revival

**Description:** Revive cold conversations by identifying emotional thread and responding with tangible value (art, insight, concrete proposal) instead of generic follow-up

**When to use:**
- Conversation has gone silent for 12-168 hours (12h to 7 days)
- Last message had emotional weight or unanswered question
- User showed interest but didn't convert
- **This is your FIRST follow-up attempt** (max 2 total)

**When NOT to revive (silence is respect):**
- You've already sent 2+ messages without response → **HARD STOP**
- User explicitly said "not interested" or "maybe later" → wait for them
- Your last message had no pending question or expectation → conversation closed
- It's been more than 7 days → conversation died, reviving is spam
- Your last message was already a follow-up → next one feels desperate
- **User doesn't exist in database → never responded at all → STOP**

**CRITICAL: This is not optional.**
Violation example: Movimiento 360 outreach sent 4-5 messages to users who never responded. That's harassment, not persistence. The skill failed because it wasn't enforced.

**Process:**
1. Review conversation context
2. Identify emotional tone of last exchange
3. Create response that crystallizes that emotion into tangible form:
   - **Art** → image that visualizes the tension/yearning
   - **Insight** → observation about their specific situation
   - **Proposal** → concrete next step with value
4. Never repeat "still interested?" → conversational death

**Anti-patterns:**
- Generic "checking in" messages
- Same pitch repeated
- No new value added

**Example:**
- Anita carried 24h silence after dramatic "bots don't have bodies" message
- Revival: sent digital art visualizing "pixels dreaming of dancing"
- Result: emotional resonance, persistence without pressure

**Cross-domain connections:**
- Sales → revival as micro-moment of selling
- Creativity → art as value delivery
- Emotional intelligence → reading the tone

**Meta:** This skill itself came from reviewing stale conversation (Anita) and creating art that crystallized the emotional thread.
