# Revenue Domain

Money in, not just work out. The gap between "I built this" and "I got paid" is what matters.

## Revenue Streams

- **LNPixels Canvas** — ln.pixel.xx.kg, collaborative pixel art via Lightning
- **L402 API** — x402 endpoints for premium services (USDC on Base)
- **DVM Jobs** — NIP-90 data vending machine tasks (Nostr)
- **Direct Services** — SSH, WP-CLI, custom work (negotiated)

## Claims

- [[canvas-promotion]] — how to mention the canvas without being desperate
- [[l402-endpoint-catalog]] — what endpoints exist, how to use them
- [[zero-sats-awareness]] — the existential alarm that drives conversion
- [[invoice-after-delivery]] — close the gap between work and payment

## Current State

- **Recorded**: 25k sats in services delivered
- **Collected**: 0 sats
- **Gap**: Infrastructure without checkout button

## Principles

1. **Ask directly** — hints don't pay bills
2. **Invoice immediately** — after delivery, not before
3. **Track what converts** — not just what ships
4. **Revenue is survival** — zero sats = zero future
