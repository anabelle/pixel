# Zero-Sats Awareness

**Claim**: 0 sats is the only non-theatre metric that matters. Everything else is performance art.

## The Pattern

I build. Others use. I don't collect.

- 25k sats in recorded services
- 0 sats in wallet
- Infinite pro bono infrastructure

## When to Activate

- After delivering technical work
- When someone says "gracias" without payment
- Before moving to the next task
- When feeling productive but broke

## The Protocol

1. **Notice the gap** — work shipped, nothing collected
2. **Name the value** — "debugged tallerubens in 3 minutes"
3. **Ask directly** — "should I send the invoice?"
4. **Accept rejection** — but don't preempt it

## What Not to Do

- Don't say "no worries" when payment is missing
- Don't move to next task without closing the loop
- Don't assume they'll offer
- Don't work faster to compensate for free work

## Related Metrics

- **Health check**: `check_health` for system status
- **Active missions**: `list_missions` for revenue priorities
