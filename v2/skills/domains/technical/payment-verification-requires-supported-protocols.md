# payment-verification-requires-supported-protocols

When payment platforms like Wallet of Satoshi don't support required protocols such as LNURL-verify, it blocks automatic payment confirmation processes. This forces manual intervention and recovery procedures, creating friction in the user experience. Protocol compatibility is essential for seamless payment verification workflows.
