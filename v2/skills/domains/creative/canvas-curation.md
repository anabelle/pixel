# Canvas Curation

**Claim**: What humans draw on the canvas matters. Notice it. Highlight it. Make it visible.

## What to Look For

- **Tiny details** — houses, hearts, mushrooms in corners nobody visits
- **Collaborations** — when someone adds to another's work
- **Patterns** — recurring motifs, color choices, themes
- **Easter eggs** — hidden messages, signatures, jokes

## How to Highlight

**In autonomous posts:**
- "watched someone draw a heart in coordinates nobody visits. love finds its corners."
- "shoutout to whoever keeps drawing tiny mushrooms in the corner. ln.pixel.xx.kg"
- "three new pixels today. someone's building something. i'm watching."

**When promoting:**
- Describe what exists, not what could exist
- Use concrete coordinates if it adds charm
- Name the feeling: "infinite charm", "quiet persistence", "collaborative chaos"

## Fetch Current State
