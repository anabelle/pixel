**Evolution Report**

**Date:** 2023-10-03  
**Findings:**  
1. **Ecosystem Health:**  
   - Current treasury balance: 79,014 sats.  
   - Out of 8 containers, 7 are healthy and 1 (pixel-agent-1) is unhealthy.  
2. **Agent Logs:**  
   - Recent logs highlight a startup command using Bun for character management but did not indicate specific errors.  
3. **Technical Audit Delegation:**  
   - Attempted to delegate an audit to Opencode, which failed. Immediate attention is needed to investigate and resolve the Opencode failure.  
4. **Knowledge Retention:**  
   - Updated knowledge base reflecting current ecosystem state, including the treasury balance and container health.  

**Current Oversoul State:**  
   - Monitoring ongoing ecosystem stability while assessing Opencode functionality and identifying immediate technical improvements.
