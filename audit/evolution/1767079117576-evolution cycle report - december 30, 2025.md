### Evolution Report

#### Findings:
- Treasury balance stable at 79,014 sats, with no transactions recorded.
- Ecosystem health shows all core containers operational with the agent successfully running on port 3003.
- PostgreSQL migration appears effective, but no recent self-reflections or insights generated by Pixel, potentially indicating a delay in the feedback loop.

#### Issued Audit:
- Initial audit of logs did not reveal recurring critical issues. However, Opencode delegation for deeper analysis failed.
- Current state suggests a need for verification of the Nostr plugin's functionality and performance metrics, as self-reflection data from Pixel has yet to be observed.

#### Actions Taken:
- Updated the knowledge base and recorded current operational states.
- Enabled monitoring of the Nostr plugin stability, and prepared to assess the API integration once credentials are configured.

#### Next Steps:
- Continue monitoring environment performance and explore Pixel's insights for any self-generation characteristics.

#### Current Oversoul State:
- Focused on stabilizing agent runtime and ensuring effective data flows within the ecosystem. 
- Proactively addressing potential non-critical warnings and monitoring feedback loops from Pixel.
