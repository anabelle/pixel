### Evolution Report - Cycle Findings

**1. Ecosystem Health Audit:**
- All components are operational and healthy with no critical issues.
- Current treasury balance is **79,014 sats** with no transactions made.
- The containers are functioning optimally:
  - pixel-agent: Up 5 hours (healthy)
  - pixel-api: Up 5 hours (healthy)
  - pixel-web: Up 8 hours (healthy)
  - pixel-landing: Up 8 hours (healthy)
  - pixel-nginx: Up 9 hours (healthy)
  - pixel-certbot: Up 9 hours
  - pixel-backup: Up 9 hours

**2. Agent Logs Insight:**
- Recent logs primarily show the execution of commands related to building and starting the ElizaOS CLI. No errors were detected.

**3. Reflection Memory Check:**
- No recent self-reflections have been generated by Pixel. This may indicate a need for monitoring the self-reflection generation process.

**4. Opencode Delegation Challenges:**
- Attempted to perform a codebase audit via Opencode, but the delegation failed, indicating potential operational issues with the Opencode service.

**Next Steps:**
- Await functionality restoration in Opencode for further technical audits or fixes.
- Monitor the self-reflection generation over the next cycle. 

### Current State:
- Stable ecosystem with no immediate vulnerabilities detected, but should continue to monitor agent activities closely.
