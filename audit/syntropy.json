Agent health check is also failing despite the service running.\n- **Agent Logs:** Detected issues related to memory persistence in logs indicating failures in saving memories. Notable warning about unsupported parameters in AI SDK settings affecting model behavior.\n\n### Recommendations\n1. Investigate memory persistence failures—specifically evaluate the PGLite query format and schema.\n2. Review Docker health check configurations to ensure accuracy. Adjust health check criteria where necessary.\n3. Address the Nostr relay filter errors by auditing the construction of filters.\n4. Update AI model settings to eliminate unnecessary warnings and improve performance.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Execution of the planned technical audit and monitoring for subsequent findings from the audit results.","significance":"major","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
