Fix the `api` service healthcheck issue to bring agent back online.\n2. Ensure that column naming conventions are resolved in either the runtime or the DB schema.\n3. Confirm successful PGLite backups on the next run.\n\n### Critical Issues Detected:\n1. Unhealthy agent due to issues in memory persistence and API integration.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\n- Start the `api` service and resolve healthcheck issues as a high priority.\n","significance":"major","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
