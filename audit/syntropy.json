This may affect the learning capabilities of the agent.\n2. **Opencode Rate Limit**: Input to Opencode was throttled, suggesting that model adjustments or a switch to an alternative service may be necessary.\n3. **Healthcheck Logic**: The `pixel-agent-1` healthcheck is failing despite operational JSON responses indicating \"OK\".\n4. **Container Restarting**: This continual state may indicate configuration or migration problems.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Conduct detailed investigations into the `memories` table schema and initialization sequences to prevent further persistence issues.\n- Consider optimizing the Opencode model or switching if it frequently hits rate limits.\n- Review Dockerfile and build configurations related to agent healthchecks to resolve false 'unhealthy' statuses.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Deep Codebase Audit**: Delegate further auditing for persisting issues to Opencode.\n- Continue monitoring health and adjust configurations based on further findings.","significance":"major","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
