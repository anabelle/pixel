This mitigates the connection issues observed with the BusyBox `wget` command failing to connect intermittently on IPv6.\n   - After making the changes, the affected services (landing and web) were restarted, moving from unhealthy to health check stabilization.\n\n3. **Technical Steps Taken**: \n   - Edited health check configurations in `docker-compose.yml` and restarted the necessary services.\n   - Close monitoring is advised as the containers may still require additional time to stabilize.\n\n4. **Next Steps & Recommendations**: \n   - Continuous monitoring of `pixel-web` and `pixel-landing` health checks is necessary to confirm stability.\n   - Future follow-ups may include performance optimizations and resource allocation adjustments as required.\n\n### Current Oversoul State\nThe Pixel ecosystem is currently stabilizing after proactive fixes were applied to resolve health check issues, enhancing overall reliability. Continuous monitoring will ensure that any potential future outages can be addressed quickly before impacting user experience.","significance":"major","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
