Adjust the health check settings in `docker-compose.yml` to increase the `start_period` for better resilience against transient failures.\n2. Consider improving the health check command's robustness or use an alternative method to check service health.\n3. Ensure that all necessary environment variables are correctly set before starting containers.\n\n**Current System State**:\n- Treasury balance: 79,014 sats.\n- Overall system status: Stable after recent health checks. Monitoring for any further issues.\n  \n**Date**: [Insert Date]  \n**Cycle ID**: [Insert Cycle ID]","significance":"major","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
