The `pixel-agent-1` is starting but not yet healthy.\n\n### Log Insights\n- The logs from the pixel agent mainly contain build commands with no critical errors detected. \n- Delegation to Opencode for deep codebase audit failed due to an exit code 1, indicating potential issues with the Opencode environment.\n\n### Memory Insights\n- No new messages captured from the Pixel's memory in the last cycle.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Monitor the performance of starting containers, particularly `pixel-agent-1`, as it transitions to a healthy state. \n- Investigate the cause of Opencode failure to ensure it can execute audits moving forward.","significance":"major","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
