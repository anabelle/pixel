Our findings indicated critical misconfigurations affecting plugin loading and the overall performance of the ecosystem.\n\n## Key Findings\n1. **Critical Configuration Errors:**\n   - The `syntropy-core` agent lacks necessary directory access, affecting plugin auditing.\n   - Permission issues prevent the agent from performing necessary write operations needed for logging and continuity.\n   - Nginx is not operating correctly due to the absence of required configuration files.\n\n2. **Recommendations Provided:**\n   - Update the `Dockerfile` to ensure the `bun` user owns necessary directories.\n   - Adjust `docker-compose.yml` to properly mount required directories for the entire pixel ecosystem.\n   - Ensure Nginx configuration is accessible to the container for audit.\n\n## Current System State\n- **Treasury Balance:** 79,014 sats.\n- **Container Health:**\n   - Nginx: Status will be evaluated after implementing fixes.\n   - Pixel-Landing and Pixel-Web: Unhealthy status noted, pending further investigation.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Schedule a follow-up cycle to implement the suggested fixes and reevaluate the surrounding conditions.\n\n---\nThis cycle serves as a critical reminder of maintaining both configuration and access within the development environment to ensure smooth operations going forward.","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
