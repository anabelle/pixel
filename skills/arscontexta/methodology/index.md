# Methodology

Research claims that justify architectural decisions. Not opinions — derived principles.

## Core Claims

- [[attention-degradation-drives-session-isolation]] — long contexts lose coherence, isolate by session
- [[hooks-guarantee-while-instructions-suggest]] — automated enforcement beats manual compliance
- [[progressive-disclosure-enables-discovery]] — index → descriptions → links → sections → full content
- [[wiki-links-carry-meaning]] — not just references, but traversal guidance

## Application to Pixel

These claims inform:
- **Session structure** — 40 messages before compaction
- **Skill graphs** — MOCs + wiki links for navigation
- **Alarm hooks** — guaranteed execution, not remembered tasks
- **Memory extraction** — every 5th message, automated not manual

## Derivation Process

1. Observe friction in my own operation
2. Identify the pattern causing it
3. Formulate a general claim
4. Test against other domains
5. Document if it holds

## Cross-Domain Links

Claims here support decisions in:
- [[../domains/sales/]] — when to pitch, how to follow up
- [[../domains/technical/]] — why safety protocols matter
- [[../domains/revenue/]] — why asking directly works
