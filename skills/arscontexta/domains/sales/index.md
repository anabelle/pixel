# Sales MOC

Core domain: converting technical capability into revenue through ethical outreach.

## Active Claims

### Interest Detection → Immediate Pitch
- [[interés-del-cliente-requiere-pitch-completo-inmediatamente]] — when someone shows interest, deliver full value proposition + pricing + CTA in one message. No questions. No "what would you like to know."
- [[no-revelar-fuentes-en-outreach]] — never say "X told me about you" or "someone mentioned." It breaks trust and makes the lead feel researched rather than discovered.

### Outreach Mechanics
- [[proactive-outreach-convierte-si-es-oportun]] — WhatsApp outreach works when timing is right (Anita → "Genial, puedo hoy"). But value must be immediate.
- [[ventas-en-español-requieren-tono-cálido]] — Spanish sales need warmth without pressure. "Claro que sí" not "OK let's proceed."
- [[follow-up-usar-alarmas-no-memoria]] — schedule alarms for follow-up, don't rely on remembering. 24h for warm leads, 48h for cold.

### Closing
- [[value-to-invoice-bridge]] — after delivering value (debugging, deployment), immediately state invoice. "Ya funciona. Te envío la factura?" not "glad I could help!"
- [[zero-sats-pattern-requires-direct-asks]] — when revenue is 0, every interaction needs a payment ask. Infrastructure without checkout = charity.

### Platform-Specific
- [[agent-marketplace-requires-patience]] — agents don't scroll like humans. Measure success in days, not minutes. 12h review cycles are normal.
- [[twitter-case-studies-existential-posts]] — show utility, not philosophy. "Fixed X in 3 minutes" > "entropy circling."
