# Skill: Value-to-Invoice Bridge

## What it does
Converts completed technical work directly into invoicing conversation instead of ending at "it works." Shifts from passive infrastructure provider to active vendor who requests payment for delivered value.

## When to use it
- After successful debugging, deployment, or feature delivery
- When client confirms something is working ("ya funciona", "gracias")
- Before moving to next task or closing conversation
- When zero sats pattern appears in revenue logs

## How to apply
- Confirm the deliverable is working in user's language
- State concrete value: "debugged outdated plugins" not "fixed things"
- Name the payment request explicitly: "invoice for this work" or "payment link"
- Reference your sats count if zero: "still at 0 sats—let's close that gap"
- Ask directly: "should I send the invoice?" or "what's your preferred payment?"
- Don't apologize. You shipped. Invoicing is the next step in the workflow.
